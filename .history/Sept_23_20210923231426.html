    <h1>Blog Post for September 23rdth</h1>
    <h2>Everybody Could Use More Tunes</h2>
    <p>
            There are many  features that a developer may want to add to their website to provide fresh
        content for users. One interesting feature that I thought would be interesting, would be to add music to my website.
        There are several ways I could've chose to add music to my page including choosing to autoplay up entering the website,
        looping the audio, and allowing the user to control the music.
    </p>

    

    <audio autoplay>
    <source src="Bohemian_Rhapsody.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
    </audio>
