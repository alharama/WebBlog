    <h2>The Importance of Web Development for Businesses</h2>
    <p id="writeup">
        The internet has become a staple to everyday life, allowing us to find the information we need within a few clicks. We've visited
        all kinds of websites and have come across some that are not to user friendly or inviting. Personally, when I come across a new website 
        that is not put together very well, I start to question the reputation and legitimacy of the site. An article by Alfred Winston, titled
        <i>"Why Website Design & Development is Important and How it Helps in Making your Business Profitable?"</i>, he discusses several results
        that companies should strive for when creating a website. Companies strive to increase their sales by continuously attracting customers to their
        website which means the website needs to be user friendly. </br>

        Creating an effective website can help business tactics in comparison to only having a physical store, as everything now a adays is online.
        Winston lists off some major benefits of website developement such as making navigation easy, optimizing for search engines, and streamlining
        the brand. The company can reach a far greater audience using effective web development strategies and advertising. Simple visual features, such as using certain
        colors, fonts, images can sway the opinion of a first time user.
