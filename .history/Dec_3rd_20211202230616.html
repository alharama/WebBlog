    <h1>The Future of Web Development: Web 3.0</h1>

    <img src="web2.png" id="web2" alt="web 2.0 graphic" />
    <p class="writeup">
      A technology that has taken over computer science as of recent is the use
      of cryptocurrency and the use of blockchains. The revolutionary technology
      has entered the world of web development with the architechture of Web 3.0
      applications on decentralized platforms. In the regular Web 2.0 web
      application, we need to have a database to store essential data, backend
      code to define the business logic, then frontend code to define the UI
      logic. Then the application is hosted on centralized servers and
      interacted with by users on the internet. The use of the blockchain for
      Web 3.0 applications which eliminates need the centralized web database
      and server. The blockchain works as a state that is collectively
      maintained by many users and uses smart contracts to define the logic of
      applications. It is a very new technology that can slightly complex to new
      users.

    <p class="writeup">
      Smart contracts are programs that run on the ethereum blockchain and
      defines the logic behind the state changes happening, written in languages
      such as Solidity or Viper. The smart contracts interact with the many
      nodes on the blockchain that keep a record of all states on the blockchain
      and must be interacted with to make desired changes to the web
      application. You can either create your own node and report changes to
      every other node whenever you desire to implement a smart contract, or
      work with thrid party applications that will manage your node
      infrasturcture. One downside to the use of the blockchain network is that
      you need to pay everytime you would like to add data, which can get
      expensive on the ethereum blockchain. There are many other services that
      are beginning to implement smart contracts and decentralized applications,
      but each service decides their own tradeoff between speed, cost, and
      decentralization. One technology working to help the Ethereum scaling
      problem is Polygon, a Layer 2 solution on top of Ethereum. The use of Web
      3.0 applications are very new and will need alot of tweaking in the
      future, but decentralized applications seem to be the future. I look
      forward to reading up more on Web 3.0 technologies and will continue to be
      interested in the Crypto and blockhain world.
