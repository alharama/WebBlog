    <h1>Creating a Real Time Sports Web Service</h1>

    <p id="writeup">
      As we come to the end of our time in CS347 Web development, I'm starting
      to understand the process better of creating Web services and
      applications. With this newfound knowledge I've already begun thinking of
      projects that I could explore in my own time that feed to my interests and
      hobbies. When quarantine first began, I attempted to create a sports
      statistics web application, but became quickly discouraged as I head no
      experience in web development. When looking through examples online of
      sports web services, I stumbled upon a real time sports application
      tutorial by Jamie Munro. He uses Node.js, express, Socket.io, and
      MySportsFeed.com to display live game scores across the NHL.

      The process of creating the web application includes setting up the
      server-client interaction, getting the sports data from the API, and
      creating scripts for real life updates. The application populates the most
      recent data when clients first enter the server and uses a set interval
      time to refresh the data. On the clients end, Munro creates a simple
      template to display the game scores using JsRender.
