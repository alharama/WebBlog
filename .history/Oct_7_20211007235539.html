        <h1> Some JavaScript Tips and Tricks Would Be Usefule</h1>

        <p id="writeup">
            Our Web development class is my first real introduction to JavaScript, so it would be helpful to learn some tips 
            and tricks to make coding quicker and more efficient. JavaScript is not vastly different than some of the languages I've
            learned, but there are key differences I have yet to embed into my head as a computer scientist. Saad Mousliki wrote an article 
            "45 Useful JavaScript Tips, Tricks and Best Practices", which is perfect for a new JavaScript programmer as myself. He provides a range of
            tips from how to append an array to another array, to dealing with a WebSocket timeout. 
        </p>

        <p id="writeup">
            One of my favorite tips that Mousliki provided is an HTML escaper function. This  would be very helpful when trying to provide
            sample HTML code in our blog without having to manually alter the code to show the raw text. Another useful tip is using the map
            function to loop through an arrays function, which would give much cleaner code. Also, to truncate an array in JavaScript we can
            just set the array length to whatever index we want the array to be cut to, rather than having loop through the array.
