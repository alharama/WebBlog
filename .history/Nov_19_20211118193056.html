    <h1>Brief History of Web Developement</h1>

    <p class="writeup">
      The history of web development has a realtively short timeline as this age
      of technology has just began to explode recently. We have great tools such
      as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc... but those were only recent inventions. We
      first take a look at the important platform needed for any website, the
      internet. In the 1960s computer scientists at the US Department of Defense
      worked with ARPANET to attempt to put together a project like the
      internet. In 1965. MIT created computers that were able to communicate
      with eathother, jumpstarting a new revolutionary technology. Some of the
      first programming languages used were COBOL and BASIC. In the 70s and 80s
      the internet and web development began to speed up introducing more
      languages such as Pascal, C, Perl, C++, etc..

    <p class="writeup">
      The birth of Open-Source Systems in the 1990s was the stepping stone of
      modern web pages when HTML was created by Tim-Berners-Lee. Open-source
      projects began to take over with the creation of the Linux operating
      system and additional programming languages such as Javascript, Python,
      Haskell, etc.... With tools such as HTML and JavaScript available, the
      internet began to take over the 2000s with many big name websites. Web
      Developement is still relatively young, but is continuously changing
      everyday. It was interesting to see the timeline of the tools we use
      everyday in class!

    <h2>Hello World Programs Over Time: COBOL to JavaScript</h2>

    <b class="example_code"> COBOL </b>
    <pre>
        IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
        PROGRAM-ID. HELLOWORLD.

        PROCEDURE DIVISION.
        DISPLAY "HELLO WORLD".
        STOP RUN.
    </pre>

    <b class="example_code"> JavaScript </b>
    <pre>
        console.log("Hello World");
    </pre>
