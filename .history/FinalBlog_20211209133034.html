    <h1>A Semester in Review</h1>

    <h2>How Would I Design A Version Of This Course</h2>

    <p>
      I believe that the format for this course provided ample materials to help
      understand the topics that needed to be learned. The textbook provided
      detailed information and examples on the topics they were trying to
      present. It provided a good basis for the projects that were assigned to
      us and encouraged following along with the code examples in our local
      editor to follow along. I think the daily labs are good exercises to try
      out the information learned from the assigned readings, but sometimes
      class time wasn't enough time to finish said labs. I think providing
      solution sets for the labs may be helpful, or provide more full exampls
      showcasing what the lab was trying to get across. The current design of
      the course is very effective in teaching students the fundamental
      information needed for Web Development in my opinion.

    <h2>
      What Helped Me Learn The Material And What Would Help Students Learn?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Following along with each chapter is crucial as most chapters build off
      eachother. As we get on to later chapters, it builds off the knowledge of
      earlier chapters which may be challenging if an earlier concept was not
      fully grasped. For example, a working web app and service can only seem so
      great when the developer doesn't have a great understanding of CSS and how
      to present the service to the user. The combination of the readings and
      labs really helped cement topics into my head for future use, even when I
      couldn't fully complete the labs. Also, looking up videos on youtube on
      certain topics may be beneficial for a different explanation on topics
      that you may not be getting.
