    <h2>Everybody Could Use More Tunes</h2>
    <p>
            There are many  features that a developer may want to add to their website to provide fresh
        content for users. One interesting feature that I thought would be interesting, would be to add music to my website.
        There are several ways I could've chose to add music to my page including choosing to autoplay up entering the website,
        looping the audio, and allowing the user to control the music. This simple addition reminds me of how this feature took MySpace 
        by storm and became a memorable to that community.

        This feature adds a personal touch to a Developers website whether it be their own personal favorite music or if a company
        would like to portray music that sends a certain message to the user. To add music using the html audio tag you need to 
        provide a url to the audio file or provide a path where the audio is located on your local machine.

    <audio autoplay>
    <source src="Bohemian_Rhapsody.mp3" type="audio/mp3" />
    </audio>
