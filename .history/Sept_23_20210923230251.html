    <h1>Blog Post for September 23rdth</h1>
    <h2>Adding News Sources to Website</h2>
    <p>
        There are many dynamic features that a developer may want to add to their website to provide fresh
        content for users. One interesting feature that I stumbled up while searching up Web Dev topics was the 
        use of live news feed built into the website. There is a method called RSS (Really simple Syndication) that allows for
        adding news content to any site. RSS is a coding solution that provides repeated automic updates for web content, which will
        allow us to keep news up to date.
