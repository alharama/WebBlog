    <h1>Creating an App using the Spotify algorithm</h1>

    <p id="writeup">
      Leading up to the creating of our project 3 application, I wanted to take
      a look at other music app ideas on the internet. While creating my Web
      service, I can imagine improving my music record service into a cool side
      project that I would actually use in the future. In the article "Letâ€™s
      Build A Full Stack App With The Spotify Algorithm and API" by Josh
      Streger, he attempts to create a spotify music reccomendation service
      using Spotifys public web API. Spotify's API generates reccomendations
      using certain provided fields such as seed artists, genres, tracks,
      acousticness, danceability, and much more.
    </p>

    <p id="writeup">
      Streger decides to create his app using React and Express, just as we are
      going to do in project 3. There are several parts to creating the
      application including setting up the backend, creating frontnd components
      and funcionality, creating tests for backend + frontend logistics, and
      then finally deploying to a production server. This was a very interesting
      read because I attempted to do this in the summer, but most of the code
      seemed very foreign to me. As we get towards the end of this class, I can
      definitely see myself creating this application with more research into
      the spotify authentification process.

    <h2>Here is an example authorization request using express</h2>

    <pre>
            const express = require('express');
            const querystring = require('querystring');
            const axios = require('axios');
            const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');


            const router = express.Router();

            router.get('/login', (req, res) => {
                    res.redirect(`https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?${querystring.stringify({
                    response_type: 'code',
                    client_id: process.env.SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID,
                    redirect_uri: process.env.SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI,
            })}`);
            });
    </pre>
