<h1>Why not learn some new tricks</h1>
<p>
        When learning a new programming language, I can use all the help I can to speed
    up my time coding. I searched the web for tips when coding in HTML and found an inviting
    article called "13 cool tricks for HTML" by Ruchi Bhargava. In the article, she lists off some style 
    tips that may not be useful to me at the moment, but are still cool nonetheless. The article showed
    how to add a horizontal line to the web page, suggesting inputs for text boxes, adding background images, 
    etc... There were many tips that will help me along my web development endevours.
        One tip that caught my eye which seemed important was how to add meta data about my website to be 
    found on search engines. I need to share my masterpeice with the world, so it seems important that they
    should be able to find me. The developer should specify a name to reference the website and some keywords.
    This is a simple, but key addition that will allow for more views of the website.
