    <h1>A Semester in Review</h1>

    <h2>How Would I Design A Version Of This Course</h2>

    <p>
      I believe that the format for this course provided ample materials to help
      understand the topics that needed to be learned. The textbook provided
      detailed information and examples on the topics they were trying to
      present. It provided a good basis for the projects that were assigned to
      us and encouraged following along with the code examples in our local
      editor to follow along. I think the daily labs are good exercises to try
      out the information learned from the assigned readings, but sometimes
      class time wasn't enough time to finish said labs. I think providing
      solution sets for the labs may be helpful, or provide more full exampls
      showcasing what the lab was trying to get across.
