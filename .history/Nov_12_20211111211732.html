    <p id="writeup">
      As we come to the end of our time in CS347 Web development, I'm starting
      to understand the process better of creating Web services and
      applications. With this newfound knowledge I've already begun thinking of
      projects that I could explore in my own time that feed to my interests and
      hobbies. When quarantine first began, I attempted to create a sports
      statistics web application, but became quickly discouraged as I head no
      experience in web development. When looking through examples online of
      sports web services, I stumbled upon a real time sports application
      tutorial by Jamie Munro. He uses Node.js, Socket.io, and MySportsFeed.com
      to display live game scores across the NHL.
