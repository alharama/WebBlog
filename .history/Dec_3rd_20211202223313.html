    <h1>The Future of Web Development: Web 3.0</h1>

    <p class="writeup">
      A technology that has taken over computer science as of recent is the use
      of cryptocurrency and the use of blockchains. The revolutionary technology
      has entered the world of web development with the architechture of Web 3.0
      applications on decentralized platforms. In the regular Web 2.0 web
      application, we need to have a database to store essential data, backend
      code to define the business logic, then frontend code to define the UI
      logic. Then the application is hosted on centralized servers and
      interacted with by users on the internet. The use of blockchain has
      allowed for Web 3.0 applications which eliminates the centralized web
      database and server.
